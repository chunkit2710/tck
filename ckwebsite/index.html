                <p class="par">Malaysia is home to a vibrant and diverse indigenous population,<br> with over 200 different ethnic groups that have lived on the Malay Peninsula and across the island of Borneo for thousands of years. <br> These indigenous communities, known collectively as the Orang Asli in Peninsular Malaysia and Dayaks in Borneo,<br> possess rich cultural traditions, languages, and practices that have been passed down through generations. <br> <br>This website serves as an exploration of the unique lifestyles, histories, and challenges faced by these communities. <br> From the jungle-dwelling Orang Asli to the culturally rich Iban, Kadazan-Dusun, and Bidayuh of Borneo, <br> we hope to showcase the diversity and resilience of these remarkable peoples.</p>
